# Cluster Evaluation

The majority of clustering data sets don't have a suitable data set to compare each other. Also, clustering may look similar to classification, but it differs a lot in character.

Data classification There is a wider collection of data with a wider cluster value, with a more refined leveling clustering within it, even if it finds a hidden separate group and gives meaning to it or belongs to another classification value.
Due to the nature of unsupervised learning, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of any indicator. Nevertheless, silhouette analysis is used as a method of evaluating the performance of clustering.

# Name
Bike Sharing Demand

# Data
The data is from Kaggle and the link is https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview

# Description
This is another Kaggle project that many data scientists participated before. There are many great solutions about this project or competition, 
but I interpret my way to solve the problme. According to Kaggle description, 
"Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership,
rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city..." The goal of this competition is the forcasting bike rental deman 
in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. using historical usage patterns with weather data.

# Model
The two models that I used are Logistic Regression and LightGBM.

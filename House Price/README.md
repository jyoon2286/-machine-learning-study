# Data
The data is from Kaggle and the link is https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

# Description
This is a Kaggle project that I study for regression analysis. The goal of this project is developing models that have the lowest RMSE(Root-Mean-Square Error). 
According to the Kaggle description, the practice skills are "Creative feature engineering" and "Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting".
Like many other kaggle project, this proejct are already solved by many other data scientist. I reference got my source from the posting on this competition, but I built my own
model and understanding for this project.
